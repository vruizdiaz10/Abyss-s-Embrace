Verse 1:
Atop the castle, he stands alone,
A hermit in his refuge, his heart's like stone,
Life's cruel ways, to him they're clear,
From his window, he peers into the abyss so near.

Chorus:
Far from the crowd, in solitude he'll stay,
His castle is his fortress, where he finds his way,
Love and trust, they caused him pain,
In his retreat, he seeks peace to gain.

Verse 2:
With kindness he tried, but deceit was his fate,
Illusory friendships, his heart they'd abate,
Fortune, it mocked him, held his hand no more,
In his tower, he found solace, his heart to restore.

Chorus:
Far from the crowd, in solitude he'll stay,
His castle, his fortress, where he finds his way,
Love and trust, they caused him pain,
In his retreat, he seeks peace to gain.

Bridge:
In the castle's shadows, I contemplate my plight,
Life's meaning eludes me, fading out of sight,
Wealth and appearance, mere illusions they seem,
In isolation, my dreams are my redeem.

Chorus:
Far from the crowd, in solitude he'll stay,
His castle, his fortress, where he finds his way,
Love and trust, they caused him pain,
In his retreat, he seeks peace to gain.

Final:
At the castle's zenith, death he'd meet,
The man finds peace in his soul's fleet,
In eternity, wounds fade, no longer cease,
In the abyss's grasp, the man finds his release.

Chorus:
Far from the crowd, in solitude he'll stay,
His castle, his fortress, where he finds his way,
Love and trust, they caused him pain,
In his retreat, the hermit's peace he'd attain.
